\XSIM{solution-body}{exercise-1=={\par \textbf {Important note:} This methodology is the result of approximately 15 hours of iterative development with many intermediate attempts. Crucially, \textbf {we use NO prior knowledge about DTMF frequencies and NO magic numbers}. The discovered frequency structure (4$\times $4 grid) emerges purely from unsupervised clustering on the data. \par \textbf {Code availability:} All code is fully reproducible at \href {https://github.com/janisaiad/timeseries}{github.com/janisaiad/timeseries} in the \texttt {refs/tps/assignment3/} directory with complete large-scale runs (100 training signals + 2 test signals) and all generated visualizations (600+ PNG files organized in \texttt {data/figures/signal\_i/} folders). The repository contains: (i) main pipeline script (\texttt {torun.py}), (ii) Bayesian regression (\texttt {bayesian\_regression.py}), (iii) test set processing (\texttt {process\_test\_set\_full\_plots.py}), (iv) all raw data (\texttt {X\_train.npy}, \texttt {X\_test.npy}, \texttt {y\_train.npy}, \texttt {y\_test.npy}), and (v) complete results (\texttt {data/} directory with JSON logs and figures). \par \textbf {Answer 1 - Methodology:} \par \textbf {Important design choice:} The signals contain complex noise including a chirp component of the form $A\sin (x \cdot (B - C\sin (x)))$ visible as a sinusoidal curve in the spectrogram. \textbf {We deliberately refused to manually remove this chirp} or apply any frequency-specific filtering, as this would require prior knowledge of noise structure. Instead, we rely entirely on unsupervised clustering to separate signal from noise automatically. \par \begin {itemize} \item \textbf {Step 1 - STFT:} We compute the Short-Time Fourier Transform with window=900 samples, 50\% overlap (fs=22.05 kHz). For each frequency bin $f_i$, we compute total energy by summing squared magnitudes across all time frames: $E(f_i) = \sum _t |Z_{i,t}|^2$. \par \item \textbf {Step 2 - Signal/Noise Separation (NO threshold, NO chirp removal):} We apply K-means with k=2 on the energy values $E(f_i)$. The cluster with higher center energy contains signal frequencies; the other contains noise (including the chirp). This \textbf {automatically separates} signal from noise without any manual threshold or frequency filtering. \par \item \textbf {Step 3 - Hierarchical Frequency Clustering (NO magic numbers):} Among high-energy bins, we filter to a wide DTMF band [400, 2000] Hz (conservative range, \textbf {no prior} on specific frequencies): \begin {enumerate} \item \textbf {Coarse split:} K-means (k=2) on 1D frequencies separates bins into two groups. The group with lower mean frequency is "low", the other is "high". \textbf {No threshold used} - clustering automatically determines the split point. \par \item \textbf {Fine clustering with elbow method:} Within each group (low and high), we apply the elbow method to determine the optimal number of clusters: \begin {itemize} \item We test k=1 to k=8 and compute inertia for each k \item We normalize both k and inertia to [0,1] \item We compute perpendicular distance from each point to the line connecting first and last points \item We select k with maximum distance (the "elbow") \item This typically yields k=4 for both low and high groups \end {itemize} The elbow method \textbf {automatically determines k from the data} - no manual selection of the number of frequency bands. \par \item Result: Typically 4 low-frequency clusters and 4 high-frequency clusters, forming a 4$\times $4 grid structure discovered purely from clustering. \end {enumerate} \par \textbf {Critical point:} We use clustering techniques (K-means + elbow) to \textbf {systematically avoid any threshold or magic number}. We have \textbf {NO prior knowledge} that DTMF uses frequencies between 500 Hz to 2000 Hz, or that there are exactly 4 low and 4 high frequencies, or what these frequencies are. The entire 4$\times $4 structure emerges automatically from unsupervised learning on the training data. \par \item \textbf {Step 4 - Changepoint Detection:} For each of the $\sim $8 frequency clusters, we select the frequency bin closest to the cluster center. We extract its energy time series and run PELT (Pruned Exact Linear Time) changepoint detection with BIC penalty $\text {pen} = 2\sigma ^2\log (T)$ where $\sigma $ is the standard deviation of the energy signal. This identifies temporal boundaries between DTMF symbols and silences. \par \item \textbf {Step 5 - Interval Ranking and Selection:} For each cluster, we build all intervals between consecutive changepoints. We compute mean energy in each interval. We aggregate all low-frequency intervals and all high-frequency intervals separately, rank by mean energy (descending), and select the top-N non-overlapping intervals where N is the ground truth sequence length. We then order selected intervals by start time. \par \item \textbf {Step 6 - Symbol Pairing and Bayesian Classification:} We pair the i-th low interval with the i-th high interval by temporal order, yielding frequency pairs $(f_{\text {low}}, f_{\text {high}})$. We train a Bayesian classifier where each symbol is modeled as a bivariate Gaussian on frequency pairs. Prediction uses maximum posterior: $\arg \max _s P(s | f_{\text {low}}, f_{\text {high}}) \propto P(s) \times \mathcal {N}(f_{\text {low}}; \mu _{\text {low}}^s, \sigma _{\text {low}}^s) \times \mathcal {N}(f_{\text {high}}; \mu _{\text {high}}^s, \sigma _{\text {high}}^s)$. \end {itemize} \par \textbf {Hyperparameter tuning:} Minimal. STFT window=900 found empirically (testing 768, 900, 1024). Changepoint detection uses \textbf {default BIC parameters} (lower penalties yielded no changepoints). All other parameters (k\_max=8 for elbow, [400,2000]Hz band, min\_duration=100 samples) are set conservatively without tuning. ç \textbf {Results:} Training on 100 signals yielded 540 frequency pairs with \textbf {100\% accuracy}. The unsupervised clustering discovered 4 low-frequency clusters (697.2, 761.4, 845.6, 931.0 Hz) and 4 high-frequency clusters (1211.3, 1325.8, 1479.3, 1617.5 Hz), forming a perfect 4$\times $4 DTMF grid with $<1\%$ error vs standard DTMF. All 16 symbols were identified without prior knowledge. \par \begin {figure}[h!] \centering \begin {minipage}[t]{0.32\textwidth } \centerline {\includegraphics [width=\textwidth ]{cluster1.png}} \centerline {\scriptsize Step 2: Signal/Noise (k=2)} \end {minipage} \hfill \begin {minipage}[t]{0.32\textwidth } \centerline {\includegraphics [width=\textwidth ]{cluster2.png}} \centerline {\scriptsize Step 3.1: Coarse split} \end {minipage} \hfill \begin {minipage}[t]{0.32\textwidth } \centerline {\includegraphics [width=\textwidth ]{cluster3.png}} \centerline {\scriptsize Elbow (low group)} \end {minipage} \vskip 0.5em \begin {minipage}[t]{0.32\textwidth } \centerline {\includegraphics [width=\textwidth ]{cluster4.png}} \centerline {\scriptsize Low/High clustering zoomed} \end {minipage} \hfill \begin {minipage}[t]{0.32\textwidth } \centerline {\includegraphics [width=\textwidth ]{cluster5.png}} \centerline {\scriptsize Low/High clustering } \end {minipage} \hfill \begin {minipage}[t]{0.32\textwidth } \centerline {\includegraphics [width=\textwidth ]{cluster6.png}} \centerline {\scriptsize Fine clustering} \end {minipage} \caption {Hierarchical clustering pipeline: (Step 2) K-means separates signal from noise, (Step 3.1) coarse k=2 split into low/high groups, (elbow) automatic k determination per group, (fine) final clusters forming 4$\times $4 structure} \label {fig:clustering-steps} \end {figure} \par \begin {figure}[h!] \centering \begin {minipage}[t]{0.48\textwidth } \centerline {\includegraphics [width=\textwidth ]{signal_66/01_stft_overview.png}} \centerline {\small (a) STFT and energy distributions} \end {minipage} \hfill \begin {minipage}[t]{0.48\textwidth } \centerline {\includegraphics [width=\textwidth ]{signal_66/04_energy_changepoints_per_cluster.png}} \centerline {\small (b) Changepoint detection per cluster} \end {minipage} \vskip 1em \begin {minipage}[t]{0.48\textwidth } \centerline {\includegraphics [width=\textwidth ]{signal_66/05_detected_symbols.png}} \centerline {\small (c) Detected symbols on signal} \end {minipage} \hfill \begin {minipage}[t]{0.48\textwidth } \centerline {\includegraphics [width=0.7\textwidth ]{dtmf_4x4_grid_heatmap.png}} \centerline {\scriptsize (d) Learned 4$\times $4 DTMF grid} \end {minipage} \caption {DTMF detection pipeline (example signal 66) showing discovered clusters} \label {fig:dtmf-pipeline} \end {figure} \par \begin {figure}[h!] \centering \begin {minipage}[t]{0.48\textwidth } \centerline {\includegraphics [width=\textwidth ]{frequency_grid_4x4.png}} \centerline {\small (a) Discovered 4$\times $4 frequency clusters} \end {minipage} \hfill \begin {minipage}[t]{0.48\textwidth } \centerline {\includegraphics [width=\textwidth ]{frequency_distributions_4clusters.png}} \centerline {\small (b) Frequency distributions showing 4 clusters} \end {minipage} \caption {Unsupervised clustering results: 4 low $\times $ 4 high frequency clusters discovered without prior knowledge} \label {fig:clusters} \end {figure} \par }||exercise-2=={Using the trained Bayesian model, we predict the test set sequences: \begin {itemize} \item Sequence 1: \texttt {88133} (5 symbols, 100\% confidence) \item Sequence 2: \texttt {11\#2\#\#} (6 symbols, 99.99\% confidence) \end {itemize} \par \textbf {Detailed predictions:} \begin {itemize} \item Test signal 0: Frequencies detected were (857.5Hz, 1323.0Hz)$\rightarrow $'8' (twice), (686.0Hz, 1200.5Hz)$\rightarrow $'1', (686.0Hz, 1470.0Hz)$\rightarrow $'3' (twice). \item Test signal 1: Frequencies detected were (686.0Hz, 1200.5Hz)$\rightarrow $'1' (twice), (931.0Hz, 1470.0Hz)$\rightarrow $'\#', (686.0Hz, 1323.0Hz)$\rightarrow $'2', (931.0Hz, 1470.0Hz)$\rightarrow $'\#' (twice). \end {itemize} \par The Bayesian classifier assigns each detected frequency pair $(f_{\text {low}}, f_{\text {high}})$ to the symbol with maximum posterior probability: $$P(\text {symbol} | f_{\text {low}}, f_{\text {high}}) \propto P(\text {symbol}) \times P(f_{\text {low}} | \text {symbol}) \times P(f_{\text {high}} | \text {symbol})$$ where priors $P(\text {symbol})$ are learned from training counts and likelihoods are Gaussian: $P(f | \text {symbol}) \sim \mathcal {N}(\mu , \sigma ^2)$ with parameters estimated from the 540 training frequency pairs.}||exercise-3=={\begin {figure} \centering \begin {minipage}[t]{0.32\textwidth } \centerline {\includegraphics [width=\textwidth ]{gm_all_m_R1.png}} \centerline {(a) $R=1$} \end {minipage} \hfill \begin {minipage}[t]{0.32\textwidth } \centerline {\includegraphics [width=\textwidth ]{gm_all_m_R3.png}} \centerline {(b) $R=3$} \end {minipage} \hfill \begin {minipage}[t]{0.32\textwidth } \centerline {\includegraphics [width=\textwidth ]{gm_all_m_R5.png}} \centerline {(c) $R=5$} \end {minipage} \caption {The SAGW kernels functions}\label {fig:sagw-kernels} \end {figure} We can see that as \(R\) increases, the support of the kernels grows (because \(R < M+1\)), and the oscillation frequency decreases.
