Number of ground truth symbols: 6
Number of filtered periods available: 1
WARNING: Only 1 filtered periods available for 6 symbols!
  This may indicate insufficient changepoints detected or too aggressive filtering.
Selected 1 biggest periods (by duration) for matching
Low frequency clusters available: 0
High frequency clusters available: 1
  WARNING: No low frequency clusters detected! This explains why only high frequencies are found.
