Each kernel spans exactly \(\pi \) radians, forming a single "mountain".

Let \(L_G\) be the laplacian of the initial graph, and let \(L_{G'}\) be the laplacian of the graph of size \(T\) that is a line, so it contains 1's only in \((i,i+1) \quad 1<=i<n\) and \((i,i-1)\quad 1<i<=n\) (symmetrically). Let \(I_N\) and \(I_T\) be identity matrix. Then the new laplacian can be expressed as: \[L_{H} = I_T \otimes L_G + \beta * L_{G'} \otimes I_N\] Where \(\beta \) is the weight we want to add in the edges representing a link with itself in consecutive timestamps.\\ It is a well known fact that if \(v_i\) and \(w_j\) are the set of eigenvectors of \(L_G\) and \(L_{G'}\) respectively, then \(w_j\otimes v_i\) are the set of eigenvectors of \(L_H\). If \(u_i\) and \(l_j\) are the eigenvalues of \(v_i\) and \(w_j\) respectively, then the eigenvalue of \(w_j\otimes v_i\) is \(u_i + \beta l_j\). \begin {figure} \centering \begin {minipage}[t]{0.8\textwidth } \centerline {\includegraphics [width=\textwidth ]{average_temperature_majority_class_timestamps.png}} \end {minipage} \caption {Average temperature.

\XSIM{exercise-body}{exercise-1=={Design a procedure that takes a sound signal as input and outputs the sequence of symbols. To that end, you can use the provided training set. The signals have a varying number of symbols with a varying duration. There is a brief silence between each symbol. \par Describe in 5 to 10 lines your methodology and the calibration procedure (give the hyperparameter values). Hint: use the time-frequency representation of the signals, apply a change-point detection algorithm to find the starts and ends of the symbols and silences, and then classify each segment. \par }||exercise-2=={What are the two symbolic sequences encoded in the test set?}||exercise-3=={Plot the kernel functions $\hat {g}_m$ for $R=1$, $R=3$ and $R=5$ (take $\lambda _n=12$) on Figure~\ref {fig:sagw-kernels}.

We can for instance classify nodes into low/medium/high frequency: \begin {itemize} \item a node is considered low frequency if the scales $m\in \{1,2,3\}$ contain most of the energy, \item a node is considered medium frequency if the scales $m\in \{4,5,6\}$ contain most of the energy, \item a node is considered high frequency if the scales $m\in \{6,7,9\}$ contain most of the energy. \end {itemize} \par \par For both signals from the previous question (smoothest and least smooth) as well as the first available timestamp, apply this procedure and display on the map the result (one colour per class). \par }||exercise-6=={Display the average temperature and for each timestamp, adapt the marker colour to the majority class present in the graph.}||exercise-7=={The previous graph $G$ only uses spatial information. To take into account the temporal dynamic, we construct a larger graph $H$ as follows: a node is now \textit {a station at a particular time} and is connected to neighbouring stations (with respect to $G$) and to itself at the previous timestamp and the following timestamp. Notice that the new spatio-temporal graph $H$ is the Cartesian product of the spatial graph $G$ and the temporal graph $G'$ (which is simply a line graph, without loop). \par \begin {itemize} \item Express the Laplacian of $H$ using the Laplacian of $G$ and $G'$ (use Kronecker products). \item Express the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the Laplacian of $H$ using the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the Laplacian of $G$ and $G'$. \item Compute the wavelet transform of the temperature signal. \item Classify nodes into low/medium/high frequency and display the same figure as in the previous question. \end {itemize}}}
